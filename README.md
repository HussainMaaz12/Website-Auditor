# A11y Auditor: An Automated Web Accessibility Checker

A full-stack, real-time MERN application that provides a beautiful, interactive, and downloadable accessibility report for any public website. This project was built from the ground up to showcase modern web technologies and solve the real-world challenge of making the web more inclusive.

## üöÄ Introduction

In a world that is increasingly digital, ensuring that web applications are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities, is not just a best practice‚Äîit's a necessity. This project, the **A11y (Accessibility) Auditor**, was born from the desire to create a tool that is not only powerful but also beautiful and enjoyable to use.

It automates the complex and often tedious process of auditing a website against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. By simply entering a URL, a user can receive a detailed, interactive, and professional report on potential accessibility violations, helping developers build a more inclusive web.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Live Animated UI:** A stunning "glassmorphism" themed interface with a live, animated gradient background provides a premium user experience.
* **Automated Auditing:** Users can enter any URL to initiate a comprehensive accessibility scan performed on the server.
* **Headless Browser Technology:** The backend leverages **Puppeteer** to run a headless instance of Chromium, simulating a real user's visit to the page to ensure accurate, real-world results.
* **Professional-Grade Analysis:** Injects and runs the industry-standard **`axe-core`** engine to detect dozens of WCAG violations.
* **Interactive & Creative Report:**
    * **Animated Summary:** High-level statistics (Violations, Passes, Incomplete) animate into view with a counting effect.
    * **Expandable Details:** The report provides a detailed, expandable list of all violations, color-coded by impact (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor).
    * **Code-Level Insight:** Users can drill down into each violation to see a description, a link to learn more, and the specific HTML code snippets of the affected elements.
* **PDF Export:** Users can download a complete, professionally formatted PDF of the audit report, generated on the fly using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architectural Choices

This project was built using the MERN stack, with each component chosen for its specific strengths:

* **Backend:**
    * **Node.js & Express.js:** Chosen for their non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is ideal for handling the I/O-heavy task of web scraping with Puppeteer. The REST API was built to be clean and scalable.
    * **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database selected for its flexibility in storing the complex, nested JSON reports generated by the `axe-core` engine.
    * **Mongoose:** Used as an ODM to provide a clear, schema-based structure for our data and simplify database interactions.
    * **Puppeteer & `axe-core`:** The core engine of the application, chosen for their industry-standard status in headless browser automation and accessibility testing.

* **Frontend:**
    * **React:** Used to build a fast, component-based, single-page application. The UI is broken down into reusable components like `AuditorPage` and `ResultsDisplay` for clean code and maintainability.
    * **React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`):** Leveraged extensively for managing component state (e.g., loading states, user input, API results) and handling side effects like animations.
    * **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Integrated for high-performance, professional-grade animations, such as the entrance of the report cards and the number counting effect.
    * **CSS3:** All styling is custom-written, focusing on modern techniques like Flexbox, Grid, custom properties, and `backdrop-filter` to achieve the "glassmorphism" theme.

## üß† Developer Experience & Challenges Faced

Building this project was a fantastic learning journey that went beyond just writing code. It involved solving real-world development challenges.

#### **Problems & Solutions:**

1.  **The Two-Server Problem (CORS):** A classic MERN stack challenge. My React frontend (`localhost:3000`) was initially blocked by the browser from talking to my Express backend (`localhost:5000`).
    * **Solution:** I learned to solve this during development by configuring the `proxy` setting in the React app's `package.json` file, which seamlessly forwards API requests to the backend.

2.  **Environment Setup (`react-scripts not found`):** I encountered a persistent error where the command to start the React app failed.
    * **Solution:** Through systematic debugging, I discovered the issue was related to running `npm install` in the wrong directory. This taught me the critical importance of understanding a monorepo's structure and ensuring dependencies are installed in the correct workspace (`client` vs. root).

3.  **Headless Browser Security (`TrustedScript` Error):** The Puppeteer script initially failed because modern websites use Content Security Policies (CSPs) to block script injection.
    * **Solution:** I refactored the audit service to read the `axe-core` library's code using Node.js's `fs` module and then execute it directly using `page.evaluate()`. This more robust method successfully bypassed the security policy.

4.  **The Broken PDF Export:** The initial PDF export was a disaster. The "glassmorphism" effect rendered as a blank white page.
    * **Solution:** I implemented a creative fix where a special CSS class (`pdf-export-mode`) is temporarily added to the report just before `html2canvas` takes its "screenshot." This class replaces all transparent, blurred backgrounds with solid, print-friendly colors. The class is removed immediately after, providing a seamless experience for the user and a perfect PDF output.

#### **Key Takeaways:**

* **Full-Stack JavaScript:** Coming from a Python/Django background, this project was a deep dive into the "JavaScript everywhere" ecosystem, from the backend logic in Node.js to the interactive UI in React.
* **Asynchronous Mindset:** Mastered `async/await` and Promises to handle long-running tasks like the Puppeteer audit without blocking the server.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Gained a strong appreciation for building UIs in a modular, component-based way with React, which is a significant shift from Django's template-based rendering.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

* **User Accounts & Audit History:** Allow users to sign up and save their audit reports to a personal dashboard.
* **Scheduled Audits:** Implement a feature to automatically run an audit on a given URL on a daily or weekly basis.
* **Visual Comparison:** Add a feature to compare two different audit reports side-by-side.
